# Quantum Coin Flip

An application for the [futurist](https://github.com/ftrst/futurist-react) framework.

It receives a stream of quantumly randomized generated numbers, then divides them by two.

Depending on whether or not the sum of the numbers is even or odd, a side of a coin (heads / tails) is assigned to it, creating a truly binary 'coin flip'.

## Installing the App
As with all Futurist Apps, this repo can be run isolated from the framework.

To install the App, review the installation guide here: https://docs.futurist.io/framework/app_walkthrough/

## Try It Out!

Quantum Coin Flip (QCF) can be utilized as a standalone [Application](https://docs.futurist.io/framework/architecture/), without any reliance on the rest of the futurist framework.

This is by design, to allow anyone to try before installing it into the larger project, should they choose to do so.

Treat it as you would any other React project:

1) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ftrst/futurist-qcf
```

2) Install the packages:
```
npm install
```

3) Run the project:
```
npm dev
```
